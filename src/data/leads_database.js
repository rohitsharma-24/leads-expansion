She has been tasked with this research. She's extremely personable on the phone, so I would make that connection right away.

She will also need a point-of-sale system, so when she shows her items at trade shows with samples, the customer will be able to pre-order.

Suzanne is small, but she wants to get a system that is more efficient than Shopify.

Its antiquated and he knows there are more technological advancements when using onscreen systems. His boss is super old school but is allowing him to switch up the program they use. They are a general construction company that take on a variety of different projects but because they typically don't sub out the earthwork process, they want to ensure they have a viable program that specific to dirt take off.
